# Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor

#### Project Overview

The **Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor** project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Mega with a microwave RADAR motion sensor to detect motion within its range. This setup allows you to monitor and detect motion using digital input and display the detection status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for readings:
     - **Motion detected!**: Indicates motion has been detected by the RADAR sensor.
     - **No motion detected**: Indicates no motion has been detected by the RADAR sensor.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use for intruder detection and security alarm systems.
- **Automation:** Trigger automated responses based on motion detection.
- **Occupancy Sensing:** Control lighting or HVAC systems based on room occupancy.

#### Notes

- Ensure the microwave RADAR sensor is positioned and calibrated according to its specifications for optimal detection range and sensitivity.
- Adjust the delay in the code to control the frequency of readings based on your application requirements.
- Experiment with different motion scenarios to understand the sensor's performance in various environments.
